## Define the board

In this module, you'll enable Dev Mode, also known as Velo. With Velo, you can add JavaScript code to your site and start to build out your application.

**:white_check_mark: Step-by-Step Instructions**

1. Turn on Dev Mode. When you do, you will notice that we now have a Velo sidebar on the left side of our screen and a **Properties and Events** panel on the right side of your IDE.

2. Change the ID of your button. First, click on your button. This should bring up the Properties and Events panel on the right side of your IDE. There is an ID field for the button. Change the ID from `button1` to `square`.

3. Click on the **Tools** panel to open the Toolbar. You can use this to resize your Container Box to your desired size. (I made my Container Box 490 by 490 px).

4. Open up the Add (+) panel and select the list section to add a blank repeater to your page.

5. Select a repeater item (this should be called Container) and bring up the Toolbar. Resize the repeater item to your desired size. This should be roughly ~⅓ the size of your Container Box. (I chose 150 px by 150 px to account for margins).

6. Select  the **Manage Items** menu and duplicate an item until you have 9 total items in the repeater.

7. You can change the **Layout** of your repeater if you desire. (I reduced vertical spacing to 10px).

8. Drag the Repeater onto your Container Box. You should be able to attach your repeater to your container.

9. Add **(+)** a button to your page. Change the size of the button to be the same size as the repeater item (Container).

10. Click the button to bring up the **Layout** menu. Change the text size to 100. (You can leave the button blank or use a filler text of ‘X’).
