## Create your board

In this module, you'll take some time to explore Wix and create a repeater, aka a Table in Wix, to use as our Tic Tac Toe gameboard.

- Getting familiar with the Wix editor
- Start to explore Repeaters


**:white_check_mark: Step-by-Step Instructions**

1. Start by creating a new project using the Wix editor. The “start from scratch” blank [template](https://editor.wix.com/html/editor/web/renderer/new?siteId=72c7b3fd-f542-4767-9335-11d43f701759&metaSiteId=5077a8f1-2276-4aa1-95f1-cb7ad4197772&autoDevMode=true) works best here.

2. Click the Add **(+)** symbol to open up the “Add to Site” panel. In the “Box” section, choose a container box to add to your page.

3. Click on the **Tools** panel to open the Toolbar. You can use this to resize your Container Box to your desired size. (I made my Container Box 490 by 490 px).

4. Open up the Add (+) panel and select the list section to add a blank repeater to your page.

5. Select a repeater item (this should be called Container) and bring up the Toolbar. Resize the repeater item to your desired size. This should be roughly ~⅓ the size of your Container Box. (I chose 150 px by 150 px to account for margins).

6. Select  the **Manage Items** menu and duplicate an item until you have 9 total items in the repeater.

7. You can change the **Layout** of your repeater if you desire. (I reduced vertical spacing to 10px).

8. Drag the Repeater onto your Container Box. You should be able to attach your repeater to your container.

9. Add **(+)** a button to your page. Change the size of the button to be the same size as the repeater item (Container).

10. Click the button to bring up the **Layout** menu. Change the text size to 100. (You can leave the button blank or use a filler text of ‘X’).
